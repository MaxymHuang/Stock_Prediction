# Stock Prediciton ML/ Stock Trading bot
This project aims to create a working ML algorithm that predicts stock trend. By using Neural Network LSTM algorithm, we train the model to accurately predicts prices with technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, MACD etc., and with this algorithm trained, we aim to implement this model into real trading strategies by creating a trading bot of our own.


For jupyter notebook setup:
